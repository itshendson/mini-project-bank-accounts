(づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ ... PHASE 1

Phase 1 of the project should be VERY SIMPLE. We are creating a savings account. Don't overcomplicate it by adding too many bells and whistles.
I just want to practice some concepts then MOVE ON with the rest of the CPSC 210 lecture notes and assignments. Phase 1 should be a simple savings account.
There will be an abstract class with both abstract and non abstract method. You will be able to interact with the application to do simple banking things.
There will be subclasses for different types of savings account offered by BMO. The savings account can deposit, withdraw, or read your balance.
Ignore the other stuff until later phases. The success of the application will be based on JUnit tests.

The purpose of this project is to practice the things that I have learned so far. The concepts I want to practice are:
- Abstract Class (extends)
- Interface (implements)
- Data Abstraction
- Mutability best practice
- Objects
- Weakening the the pre-condition
- Strengthening the post-condition
- helper

Was accidentally forced to learn:
- JUnit
